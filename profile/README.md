# Rust on the Wii U

> [!WARNING]
>**IN DEVELOPMENT**: Expect bugs, unexpected behaviour, changing APIs, and incomplete documentation.

The goal of this project to to create a simple way to write Wii U Homebrew software via Rust. This is achieved by wrapping the [devkitPro](https://github.com/devkitPro) toolchain (C/C++) using bindgen and providing rusty abstractions to write convenient, typical, and std-like Rust code.
