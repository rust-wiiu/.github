## Goal

The goal of this project is to create a simple way to write Wii U homebrew software in Rust by providing a complete, Rust-native toolchain for CafeOS, the operating system of the Wii U.

## Acknowledgements

We would like to thank the contributors to [devkitPro](https://github.com/devkitpro), [wiiu-env](https://github.com/wiiu-env), and the entire Wii U homebrew scene. Without your work, this project would not be possible. We aim for collaboration, not competition.
