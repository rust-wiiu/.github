# Rust on the Wii U

**IN EARLY DEVELOPMENT**

The goal of this project to to create a simple way to write Wii U Homebrew software via Rust. This is achieved by wrapping the [devkitPro](https://github.com/devkitPro) toolchain (C/C++) using bindgen and providing rusty abstractions to write convenient and typical Rust code.
