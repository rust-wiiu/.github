# Contributing Guidelines

As the project is still small, we decided to keep the "guidelines" brief:

* Be nice and use common sense.
* Avoid actions you wouldn't appreciate in your own projects or community.

In case you want more complete or direct instructions, take a look at [How to Contribute to Open Source?](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/).
