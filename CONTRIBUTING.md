# Contributing Guidelines

## TL;DR

* Be nice and use common sense.
* Avoid actions you wouldn't appreciate in your own projects or community.

In case you want more complete or direct instructions, take a look at [How to Contribute to Open Source?](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/).

## Use of LLMs

We have no problem with AI generated code as long as its reviewed and contributed in good faith.

## Why GPL-3.0?

We chose to license our main contributions under [GPL-3.0](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/) to foster an open and fair ecosystem of an already niche and small community. We encountered individuals who gatekeep code and implement unreasonable anti-debugging measures (like triggering BSOD when "detecting" network analyzers). By using a more restrictive open-source license we want to (at least in theory) avoid such behavior.

Smaller things like utilities are mostly licensed under the [MIT License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) to avoid unnessecary complications.
